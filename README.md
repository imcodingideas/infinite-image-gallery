# My Preferred React Setup

This is a small starter project for my new react applications. This is a very opinionated, and pull requests are welcome.

### Quickstart

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:imcodingideas/preferred-react-setup.git
```

```bash
# install your dependencies
yarn install
```

```bash
# running your server locally
yarn dev
```

To help us get started, I've add setup the project with the following files to start with:

  - `./src/app/index.js`
  - `./src/app/styles.css`
